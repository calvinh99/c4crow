# c4crow

This is a repo for training connect4 rl agents. This is a solved project, there are many connect4 rl repos out there because the game is easy to simulate from scratch, rules are simple and intuitive, and the overall complexity is not high. This serves more as my own foray into RL and will be a stepping stone for more ambitious projects in the future.
