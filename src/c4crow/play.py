    # FOUND A BIG BUG in the Minimax, if given obvious opportunity to win it won't! Because if the future
    # score for an earlier column is a win, then it's already infinity! So if another infinity it won't update!
    # We need to add a gamma like 0.9 that multiplies to the score of each turn, so that earlier turns are prioritized!
    # And we shouldn't use infinity, we should use a large positive number, e.g. 1 million.
    # Note: the reason we minimize opponent score is not to make it make the worst moves, but rather the best moves!
    #       why min instead of also max? Simply because we need a way to differentiate for each player the outcomes
    #       from opponents. E.g. if my opponent also max then when it's my turn and I see two branches that both
    #       return 1 million score, which is my win and which is my opponent's win? If opponent minimizes then 
    #       it's clear the -1 million is my loss!
